# Chat Application

This is a chat application built using Node.js, Express.js, WebSocket and Socket.IO. It allows users to chat with each other using different rooms. The chat functionality is not limited to within a single room, enabling users to communicate across different rooms.

## Features

- Real-time communication: Users can send and receive messages instantly in the chat rooms.
- Multiple rooms: Users can join different rooms and chat with others who are in the same room.
- Username and room selection: Users need to provide a username and room name to enter the chat.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used to build the server-side of the application.
- Express.js: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js used for routing and handling HTTP requests.
- WebSocket: A protocol that enables two-way communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection.
- Socket.IO: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
